0,"❤ Instagram worthy view! Luxury High-rise Downtown","We have had an incredible trip! Rod’s apartment was perfect. His description and photos of the apartment painted an incredible picture and it still exceeded our expectations. The location couldn’t have been better as we were just a few steps from public transportation and a market for groceries was right at the corner. - - Even when we came inside to escape the rain, we had a spectacular view of the city. The whole building was super clean, comfortable, stylish, and safe. Rod was always super quick to respond to any questions we had and gave us great recommendations for local restaurants. We would love to stay here again next time we’re in Chicago."
0,"❤ Instagram worthy view! Luxury High-rise Downtown","Just like everyone else said, the view is spectacular. This apt is sparkling clean and breathtakingly beautiful. I was in Chicago for a work meeting and loved coming back in the evenings to this comfortable, homely, beautiful apt. I had no trouble getting in each time.. the women at the front desk were all friendly (I made a point of saying hello to each of them so they were greeting me like old friends after 2 days). It's close to everything - small market just 200 feet away allowed me to stock the fridge. I highly recommend Rod and his lovely apt."
0,"2 Bedroom Upstairs Apartment Parking $10/ Day","Grace’s place is sparkling clean. Even on barefoot you wouldn’t feel dust on your feet. The place is so stylish and I love the simple touches on every part of her house. It is a great value for money being a 2bedroom and can also accommodate more people with the 2sofabeds in the living room. The kitchen is complete with stove, oven, microwave, fridge, cooking ware and utensils. The place is very close to grocery store, some resto and the Belmont Blue station. This is such a great place and I will definitely stay again when i go back to Chicago."
0,"2BR Bursting w/ Character in Hip Logan Square!","I love love love Danielle's place. It's extremely charming and well decorated. You can definitely tell she put a lot of effort into all the details of the apartment. It was perfect for a winter visit to Chicago with the amazing fireplace and heated floors. The walkways and stairs were kept clear of snow and salted. We even heard a snow blower once or twice ;). There was always parking available on the street right outside the house. Which was a major plus for us. The neighborhood was great. Plenty of places to eat and bars to check out. I would highly recommend staying here and will likely book it again."
0,"2BR Bursting w/ Character in Hip Logan Square!","Danielle’s space was perfect for our trip to Chicago. There were four of us, so we did two in each bed — totally comfortable. As it was February in Chicago, we loved the fireplace to keep the space nice and warm. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend."
0,"Augusta's Secret Garden | Noble Square|Wicker Park","Heather and JP are wonderful hosts!! Their space is incredibly stylish and really unique. We loved the garden area and enjoyed sitting outside to eat breakfast and relax. It is in an amazing location, within walking distance of so many great restaurants! We really appreciated their flexibility with check-in and all the special touches that were included. This is one of the best Airbnb's that we've ever stayed in! We'll definitely stay here again whenever we're in Chicago. If this place is open, then book it. You'll love it!"
0,"Augusta's Secret Garden | Noble Square|Wicker Park","One of our favorite AirBnB locations ever! Hip, comfortable and in a great location. Heather and JP have thought of everything you will need to enjoy your stay. We loved the privacy of the location. It was so hip and stylish, as well as super comfy. Felt like home. You are only a 5-7 min walk to the L. Bus transport is easily accessible. As well, the neighborhood is very cool. It is close to many other fun areas of west Chicago. Not far from downtown either. We didn’t even find a need to go to the magnificent mile. There is too much fun to be had hanging out in this area of town. We did go to Logan’s Square a bit. It’s very close. Loads of good bars and food. - We would definitely stay here again. They have set a high bar for what to expect for future stays with AirBnB!!"
0,"Augusta's Secret Garden | Noble Square|Wicker Park","We had a great stay at Heather and JP’s. Our schedule was a bit in flux but they were very accommodating to our changing arrival time. - - The space itself is really a hidden gem tucked away behind a lovely garden for privacy and quiet. The loft was so unique and charming and they did a great job to maximize the space. It’s very functional but stylish. Just a note to be careful on the steps approaching the bed/loft area and to watch your head as it’s a bit of a low clearance. - - We had an easy time street parking our car directly outside the unit which was extremely convenient and one less thing to have to worry about. We also appreciated the easy self check-in/out process. - - The location was convenient to exploring some really cool shops, bars, and restaurants nearby. It was a great way to experience some local flavor outside of the more touristy stuff. - - Thanks for a great visit!"
0,"Augusta's Secret Garden | Noble Square|Wicker Park","My sister and I absolutely loved staying at Heather and JP's place. This was our first time booking an Airbnb and the bar is set really high for any future bookings anywhere else. The location is great. The loft is beautifully decorated, very cozy and very clean. The complimentary snacks were also a very nice touch. Our friends that were staying at a different Airbnb stopped by for a few minutes and they were upset they didnt book this first. This place is truly charming. If we're ever in Chicago we hope we can stay here again. Thanks Heather & JP for being such great hosts and providing everything one would need for a perfect stay."
0,"Bright, Modern Apartment in a Vintage Greystone","This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable. The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. - The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!"
0,"Bright, Modern Apartment in a Vintage Greystone","We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again"
0,"Charming, Spacious 1BR Studio in Belmont Cragin","Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!"
0,"Cozy Coach House","We had a lovely stay here and would come back in a heartbeat! Scott was so welcoming and responsive, and very thoughtful about making sure that we had everything we needed. The coach house is bright and spacious, tidy, and had plenty of amenities -- from toiletries to an iron to fresh eggs in the fridge. The neighborhood is peaceful, with easy access to public transit and some great cafes and restaurants nearby (try brunch at m. henry!) A perfect launchpad for exploring Chicago, or for taking some time to rest and relax."
0,"Enjoy Chicago’s Nightlife from Studio Apartment","Nala's place is a nice, cozy space. It is super close to public transportation, a post office, salons, a boutique, some tasty eateries and murals. It is about a 30 minute ride on the train to the city center, which isn't bad at all. There is a bar below that can play music until 5am and some patrons that hang outside to smoke for a little. If you are a super light sleeper, this is not the place for you. The noise did not bother me one bit and Nala provides white noise machines just in case the noise is a bit bothersome. The bed is super comfortable and the kitchenette is great for heating up some food or making something small. Nala is also helpful and communicates with you in you in advance of your trip so all is well. Overall, I loved the style, location, and convenience of Nala's studio. Nala is a great host; I would love to stay here again!"
0,"Enjoy Chicago’s Nightlife from Studio Apartment","Nala's place is absolutely perfect. We felt like one of the locals in this studio apartment, and we both already decided we're keeping this in mind for our next trip! - - Some great points: - - Decor is adorable. Especially loved the bamboo shades to block out the street lamps. - - Amenities are spot on. Coffee, shampoo, you name it. - - Area is great. Close to public transport and found free street parking close by. We also loved having the 7-Eleven right below us! - - Speaking of businesses below, don't worry about the noise from the pub. It was plenty muffled, and if you still find yourself struggling to sleep, there's the white noise machine!"
0,"Entire place with free parking.","We stayed for 5 days, and had a very enjoyable stay. Jose was very friendly and answered any questions quickly. He gave us restaurant recommendations, which definitely made our stay better! You can hear his family walking in the apartment upstairs, but that is the nature of apartment living, and did not detract at all from the loveliness of the apartment. The driveway to park in was a definite bonus, it helped us save money by driving in instead of flying. It's nearby public transportation, so we left our car in the driveway and avoided having to pay for parking all week. We would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves in Chicago once more."
0,"Entire place with free parking.","Staying at Jose’s was magnificent. The apartment is very clean, stylish & perfect for a getaway! Jose accommodated my family in every way possible, from letting us check in early, drove us to our event we were in town for & gave great suggestions of places to visit, eat & easiest ways to get around Chicago. I would definitely recommend his place to family, friends & anyone else looking to visit the city. It’s within perfect distance of downtown and major attraction areas but also far enough away to where it is quiet & relaxing. The neighborhood itself is very family oriented and I loved having his driveway to park in, made life a lot easier! We will definitely be back!"
0,"Entire place with free parking.","We really enjoyed our stay at Jose's. It is very clean and the space itself is very comfortable. We especially loved the bed and duvet which are super comfy and the bathroom is great. It takes about 45 mins to get into downtown but there are transport links close by and Jose is very helpful and offered to give us a few rides to the nearby metro station. There are lots of restaurants and shops in the area and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Some reviewers and Jose himself mentioned that he and his family live above the apartment but we barely heard them to be honest. Excellent value for money!"
0,"Explore Chicago from an Urban Sanctuary with Free Parking","This place is wonderful! It may be a studio but you won’t feel like it is. The decor is definitely done by a professional (or someone with great style). I’m taking some ideas home with me to spruce up my decor! The location at first I thought was in a gritty neighborhood but it turned out nice, there’s a grocery store just a block away too which is nice. Downtown Chicago is about a 45-55 minute Uber ride during the week. Also the host was great and I love that they texted instead of called!"
0,"Explore Logan Square from Renovated Condo with Free Parking","Came into Chicago during the worst of the snow storm this year, and Leo & Alex's home was everything we could ask for and more! Lizbeth, who manages the rental responded to all of my texts immediately and was very attentive to our needs. Location/neighborhood is superb as we were within 10-15 mins drive of trendy restaurants and bars.. Home space was very trendy and cozy, which was great for hanging out when the storm was heavy, and beds were probably the most comfortable I've slept on in all of my stays on Airbnb. I would absolutely love to stay here again whenever back in Chicago. - - Just note that if the snow is ever really bad during your stay, that it can be a bit difficult to get in/out of the parking area.. Factor in extra time to dig out and defrost your car and driveway, which from a Californian, wasn't as bad it seemed..."
1,"❤ Instagram worthy view! Luxury High-rise Downtown","We enjoyed our stay at Rod's place! The pictures are accurate, and the view is truly amazing. The apartment was clean, and we loved the amenities such as the outdoor pool, the game room with pool table, the gym, and the roof deck where we could see the Navy Pier fireworks in the distance. The location worked well. Not far from the subway, walking distance to many attractions, and several restaurants and convenience stores right there in case we needed something. We did not meet Rod, but he communicated almost immediately when we had questions, offered helpful tips with public transit, and his check-in directions were clear. Very happy with this experience!"
1,"2BR Bursting w/ Character in Hip Logan Square!","Danielle's place is very roomy, clean, and comfortable to stay in. Everything you need is in her place even a washing machine and dryer. The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself. My sister and her family loved staying there. They had two small children and there was plenty of room for everything that they brought. There is also a nice fenced in backyard living space when the weather is nice for you to enjoy. I would highly recommend Danielle's place for your next trip to Chicago. It is within walking distance of Logan Square and all it has to offer."
1,"2BR Bursting w/ Character in Hip Logan Square!","If you want to have a a good time in Chicago, don't stay at Danielle's place..... - If you want to have A FABULOUS TIME IN CHICAGO, STAY HERE! - I cannot rave about this place enough. So cozy. So well equipped with everything you could ever need. Danielle has a very charming place with thoughtful touches all around. - Heated floors, a fireplace, fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. We felt right at home. My colleagues and I kept looking around saying, ""I love this place. I don't want to leave"". On more than one night, we decided to stay in (rather than go out) just so we could enjoy the fire, movie, selection, and some homemade pasta! I will definiltey be recommending this to anyone and everyone who plans to visit Chicago. BONUS: Just down the street from the best diner/vegan food in the world."
1,"Augusta's Secret Garden | Noble Square|Wicker Park","We had a wonderful stay at Heather and JP's apartment. The apartment is very fresh and clean. It's lovely decorated and the kitchenette is well equipped. There is a wonderful garden which is an oasis of peace in the busy city of Chicago. The location is great, only a 5 to 10 minute walk from Division & Milwaukee CTA subway station. Round the corner on Milwaukee Avenue there's a bus stop with buses going downtown. It's very quiet at night which offers you a great sleep. Heather and JP are great hosts who will help you with all your questions. - - All in all we had a very comfortable stay. We would definitely recommend this place to family and friends."
1,"Charming, Spacious 1BR Studio in Belmont Cragin","We absolutely loved our say in Christopher's place. While it is a basement space, it has all the privacy you need including your own entrance. The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus. - - We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!"
1,"Cozy Coach House","Scott and Jill are wonderful hosts who worked extremely responsively with us as our scheduled arrival changed. They helped us figure out some of the neighborhoods we were looking for an apartment, gave us some tips on cool places to eat, and introduced us to their sweet doggo, Bonnie. - - Their garage loft is a lovely, very clean space in a very quiet neighborhood. You walk through their beautiful garden and backyard, through their garage, and up into the spacious, well-lit space. There’s a full sized bathroom (bigger than most hotel rooms), decked out kitchen, and comfy sitting nook. - - Great for couples and families, or just the solo traveler that needs some quiet space!"
1,"Foodie Paradise in Logan Square area - Sunny 1 BDR","I took a Chicago staycation to finish my book and Natalia's second-floor apartment was the perfect getaway. It was more than roomy for me, being just one traveler, but I loved the amount of space and light she creates in your classic Chicago ""long-but-not-wide"" floorplan. There was more than enough light and her cheerful plants and art made me feel right at home. Small touches like a welcome note, snacks, and a guide to the neighborhood were wonderful and I actually found two amazing eateries during my stay thanks to her helpful guidance. - - Water was always hot. Automatic lights and Nest heat made me feel spoiled. And there were ample towels, toiletries, and plateware to be found. I literally rolled in with my suitcase and I was home. - - If I were to make any change, it would be the small addition of having more blankets or comforters available. The heat in the apartment was perfect but I like to sleep under many layers at night (I struggle with this at hotels too!)."
1,"Foodie Paradise in Logan Square area - Sunny 1 BDR","Our stay at Natalia’s was wonderful and we’d come back again - it was as pictured but even better in person. We loved all the plants, the way it was furnished, a very unique space and very comfortable and clean. We enjoyed the coffee, the automatic lighting and smart heating, and little touches like the book with suggestions and handwritten welcome. The area is great too - there’s lots of restaurants and cute shops nearby. Uncharted books was a favourite of ours. In our opinion it was nice to stay out of downtown yet still close to anything you may need. Natalia was also a great host she communicated clearly and even checked in with us to make sure all was well. Thanks Natalia!"
1,"Hot Tub Heaven","Loveeeeee this place! Its make me and my friend feel like a home-y! We barely couldn’t get out of bed. We had relaxing vibe around here. This is the best best best birthday surprise for my best friend and she love it! So is Marilee, a dog was too chilling! This is our first best experience ever to book the first Airbnb spot! I’m so glad I chose the right one! Thank you so much for allowing us to stay extra night!! We couldn’t stop talking about how much we had so much fun and we literally chilling lot there. Your place are so relaxing and perfect for stress-free mini vacation! - - For anyone you who planning on going to Chicago! Book this place! Trust me, it’s a lifesaver! These hosts are extremely outgoing, lovely couple with sweet personality! They would check on you to make sure everything you need to keep you comfort! - - Oh on behalf, I couldn’t live without their outdoor hot tub and mediated room! ❤️"
1,"Hot Tub Heaven","Where do I begin?! My boyfriend and I are an eclectic couple, and staying in the artsy, eclectic unit of Steven and Sara’s couldn’t have been more perfect. We loved looking at all the artwork and woodwork in the house, and we were more than comfortable. It honestly felt like staying with friends as Steven and Sara were both very friendly and inviting, and we had a great time conversing with them. They both went out of their way to help us and make us comfortable. We will be back next time we are in Chicago!"
