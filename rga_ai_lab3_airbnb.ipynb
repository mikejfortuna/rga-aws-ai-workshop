    "We enjoyed our stay at Rod's place! The pictures are accurate, and the view is truly amazing. The apartment was clean, and we loved the amenities such as the outdoor pool, the game room with pool table, the gym, and the roof deck where we could see the Navy Pier fireworks in the distance. The location worked well. Not far from the subway, walking distance to many attractions, and several restaurants and convenience stores right there in case we needed something. We did not meet Rod, but he communicated almost immediately when we had questions, offered helpful tips with public transit, and his check-in directions were clear. Very happy with this experience!\n",
